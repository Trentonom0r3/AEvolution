# AEvolution Developer readme
- This file contains helpful information about learning/extending this project

# Terminology and naming conventions
- Structure: F stands for File; D stands for Directory
- Path: Please use `/` instead of `\` for paths as that's the international standard and `\` gets sometimes seen as an escape character
- Path: `*` is a placeholder for anything valid
- Path: `-` at the start means it inherits part(s) of a previously referenced path (ex: `Project.vcxproj`, `-.user`)
- Sub-projects: When creating bindings for a new language, name it `AEvolutionBinds*` where `*` is the language abbreviation in uppercase (ex: `Python` -> `PY`)

# Structure 
- D `AEvolutionNAME`: A sub-project where NAME is a placeholder
- D `Project`: The main `.vcxproj` files used by the other sub-projects as well as a main .sln file to preview all the code but to compile, the sub-project .sln files need to be used
- D `src`: Code that is shared by most sub-projects (Headers/Resources/Util)
- F `README.md`: Main readme used to explain what the whole project is for, from a non developer perspective
- F `README_dev.md`: developer readme used to explain how it all works and how to contribute

# Sub-project dependencies
- `AEvolutionPlugin`: Depends on nothing (besides stuff in .vcxproj, obviously)
- `AEvolutionTEMPLATE`: Depends on nothing but is shadow-linked `AEvolutionPlugin`.aex (which needs to be inside AE's Plug-ins folder). Used to build specific language bindings; This folder should actually be called `AEvolutionBindsTEMPLATE` but Git is acting up and doesn't let me rename it without losing all the edit history

# New sub-project
When creating a Visual Studio Project these these steps are required to do. There is a `AEvolutionTEMPLATE` sub-project which should be used to create new bindings
## Structure
- D `Project`: Contains the VS (.vs, .vcxproj, ...) files
  - Note: If there are multiple VS projects required, simply create a sub folder and move all the files that are expected to be here in there (ex: `AEvolution/Project` -> `AEvolution/Project/Win`) and do not have a VS project in the dir then, if there's a main one simply put it inside `Project/Main`
  - Note: The project-name usually is the name of the sub-project folder
  - F `ProjectName.sln`: Filename: should be named after the project-name (and append _NAME when Project contains sub-Project folders, see `AEvolutionPlugin/Project`) (should be named because it gives VS additional information). Needs the name of the project inside of it to be changed as well to the project-name
  - F `Project.vcxproj.settings`: Contains paths/settings around the project, always includes `./Project.vcxproj.user` (not a default file by VS)
    - The `<Import Project="PATH" />` path needs to be adjusted to load the [Main .settings](./Main.vcxproj.settings) file
    - The $(ProjectName) path-macro needs to be adjusted
    - The $(TargetExt) path-macro needs to be adjusted
  - F `Project.vcxproj.user`: Custom paths/changes that may change from user to user. `Project.vcxproj.settings` should have more info on top of the import line (see [Main .settings](./Main.vcxproj.settings))
  - F `Project.vcxproj` (or -.anything else) are either created through VS or the project build step itself. Should always be the same no matter the directory/name (as long as above are taken care of)
  - D `.vs`: Auto-generated by Visual Studio
- D `src`: Contains the source code
  - F `main.*`: Expects this to be the main entry/build file, usually is main.cpp. (This is optional but recommended)

# Todo
- `AEvolutionPlugin`: Fix that one `'..\AEvolution_PiPL.r'` file not being built before being required or so resulting in first clean build to fail but not second (Error: C1083)
